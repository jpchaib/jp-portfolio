# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project was developed in a React framework and using Vite as a build tool. The main goal of this project is to showcase the projects I have developed during the _nology consultancy program, provide information about myself and my skills, and offer ways for others to contact me.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

`git clone https://github.com/jpchaib/jp-portfolio.git`

`cd my-portfolio`

`npm install`

Then, start the development server:

`npm run dev`

This will start the development server and open the app in your default browser. You can now make changes to the code and see the updates in real-time.

## Building for Production
To build the app for production, run the following command:

`npm run build`

This will create a production-ready build of the app in the `dist` directory.
