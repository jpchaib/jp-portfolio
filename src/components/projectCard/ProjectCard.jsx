The MVP of this project was to build a two-paged website that would contain a grid of products, also exposed by a carousel, stored in Firestore, containing some fields, such as price, quantities, nameâ€¦ . All data should`ve been stored in Firestore and fetched by the frontend, using a React application. While building my React application, I realised that, instead of creating a product, one by one, either manually or using a loop in my application as a seeder, I could, instead, use an existing API and fetch items to be used as my range of products. Then, I could use the Firestore as a database for user`s carts if I also implement an Authentication process. In the end, my project was selling pokemons, fetched from the PokeAPI, and stored in user`s carts. You can find it at my GitHub page.",
